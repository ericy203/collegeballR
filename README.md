README
================

This R package provides easy access to college sports (NCAA) data via stats.ncaa.org. Note if you are trying to get baseball data, I would look at Bill Petti's [baseballr](http://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) pkg.


Install
-------

``` r
# from github:
# devtools::install_github("meysubb/collegeballR")
```

For additional details please refer to the documentation [site](https://meysubb.github.io/collegeballR/)

If you'd like to suggest anything (can be sport specific or general), create a github issue. Or tweet at me \[@msubbaiah1\](<https://twitter.com/msubbaiah1>).
